# Suggestions to Improve TaxJar Assets

Hello to anyone from TaxJar who has made their way to viewing this! üëã

The purpose of this document is to list several improvements that came to mind while famiiliarizing myself with TaxJar's business (centered mostly around [developers.taxjar.com](https://developers.taxjar.com)).

Feel free to send a pull request to check off any items as they're completed.

### Legend üó∫Ô∏è

|   |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `[characters or words]`  | add or replace with `characters or words`  |
| `[-characters or words]`  | delete `characters or words`  |
| `[-]` | add a dash `-` |
| `[...]` | just an [ellipsis to indicate omission of part of the quote](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/55820/how-would-you-properly-show-deletion-of-unnecessary-text-in-a-quot) - no change necessary


### Website üåê


- https://app.taxjar.com/dashboard

  - [ ] No way to close self-guided tour `appcues` popup in Chrome 74.0.3729.131

  - [ ] Related typo:

    - "Guess what? We'll even give you a FREE AutoFile Credit[space]for completing our demo!"

- https://www.taxjar.com/states/

  - [ ] **Update React version** (here and anywhere else React is used) in case any bugfixes or performance improvements apply (perhaps use a tool to automate this; e.g., Greenkeeper or Renovate).
 
- http://www.fbasalestax.com/

  - [ ] **Implement HTTPS** ("Not Secure" in Chrome)

- https://developers.taxjar.com/api/guides/#cart-integrations

  - [ ] This section currently only lists the following integrations:
    - Magento
    - Magento 2
    - Stripe
    - WooCommerce
  - Should the other integrations be listed here as well? E.g.:
    - Amazon
    - Paypal
    - etc.
  - Or, is this section strictly for ‚Äúcart integrations‚Äù and not marketplace integrations? In that case, would at least the following apply?
    - Square
    - Squarespace
    - Shopify
    - BigCommerce
    - Ecwid

- https://www.taxjar.com/states/california-sales-tax-online/#how-to-collect-sales-tax-in-california

  - [ ] "Here‚Äôs the [state‚Äôs official Sales and Use Tax rates PDF](http://www.boe.ca.gov/pdf/pub71.pdf), also known as Publication 71."
  
    - It seems the BOE no longer administers the sales/use tax in CA and this link is no longer valid.
    
    - Perhaps link to http://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/rates.aspx from the CDTFA (not Publication 71).

  - [ ] "Once you‚Äôve figured out how much [-to] sales tax to charge to your customers, it‚Äôs time to report and file.‚Äù

- https://www.taxjar.com/states/california-sales-tax-online/#when-are-california-sales-tax-returns-due

  - [ ] see the [California monthly prepayment due dates here](http://www.boe.ca.gov/sutax/fill_dates.htm).

    - BOE link is no longer valid

    - consider linking to https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/sales-use-tax-returns-filing-dates.htm

  - [ ] The 2019 California Monthly Sales Tax Filing Due Dates table seems to be calculating incorrectly.

    - According to the above link ‚ÄúReturns are due at the end of the month for the previous month.‚Äù

    - E.g., for June the due date is July 31.

    - The following months appear to be incorrect in the table:

      - Feb
      - May
      - Jul
      - Oct

- https://www.taxjar.com/states/california-sales-tax-online/#how-to-file-sales-tax-in-california

  - [ ] "1. File online ‚Äì [File online at the California Board of Equalization](https://efile.boe.ca.gov/boe/boe_login.jsp)."

    - Will want to update this to a CDTFA link when appropriate.

  - [ ] ‚Äú2. File by mail ‚Äì You can use [California‚Äôs short form sales and use tax return](http://www.boe.ca.gov/pdf/boe401ez.pdf) and file through the mail, [‚Ä¶].‚Äù

    - Update BOE link to https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/DownloadFile.ashx?path=/formspubs/cdtfa401ez.pdf

  - [ ] ‚Äú[Late] Payment Penalty ‚Äì 10% of sales tax owed (Source)‚Äù

- https://www.taxjar.com/states/california-sales-tax-online/

  - [ ] "State Resources‚Äù in sidebar

    - Will want to update BOE links here as well.
 
### SmartCalcs API (Perhaps update with next version)

- [ ] GET https://api.taxjar.com/v2/categories

```
{
  "product_tax_code": "40030",
  "name": "Food & Groceries",
  "description": "Food for human[-s] consumption, unprepared‚Äù
},
{
  "product_tax_code": "30070",
  "name": "Software as a Service",
  "description": "Pre-written software, delivered electronically, but access[ed] remotely.‚Äù
}
```

- [ ] GET https://api.taxjar.com/v2/summary_rates

  - Consider updating `summary_rates` in response to a JSON object rather than a JSON array.

  - That way, integrations/users can look up a rate in constant rather than linear time after parsing the response.

  - One possibility is to concatenate `country_code` and `region_code` for each key; e.g.:

```
{
  ‚Äúsummary_rates‚Äù: {
    ‚ÄúUS_CA‚Äù: {
      ‚Äúcountry_code‚Äù: ‚ÄúUS‚Äù,
      ‚Äúcountry‚Äù: ‚ÄúUnited States‚Äù,
      ‚Äúregion_code‚Äù: ‚ÄúCA‚Äù,
      ‚Äúregion‚Äù: ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù,
      ‚Äúminimum_rate‚Äù: {
        ‚Äúlabel‚Äù: ‚ÄúState Tax‚Äù,
        ‚Äúrate‚Äù: 0.065
      },
      ‚Äúaverage_rate‚Äù: {
        ‚Äúlabel‚Äù: ‚ÄúTax‚Äù,
        ‚Äúrate‚Äù: 0.0827
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  - (Note: this would result in a key of `UK_null` for UK VAT tax and other, similar entries.)

  - This way you could look up the rate in Node.js, for example, with:

```js
JSON.parse(res).summary_rates.US_CA.average_rate.rate; // O(1) constant time
```

  - Rather than something like:

```js
JSON.parse(res).summary_rates.find(({country_code, region_code}) => country_code === ‚ÄòUS' && region_code === ‚ÄòCA‚Äô).average_rate.rate; // O(n) linear time
```

- [ ] POST https://api.taxjar.com/v2/addresses/validate

  - When sending a request from a basic plan (and not TaxJar Plus),

    - ~~send a `403` - Forbidden or `401` - Not Authorized error code~~

    - ~~rather than a `500` - Internal Server Error error code.~~

    - See issue [#1](https://github.com/ScottRudiger/TaxJar-Suggestions/issues/1); this is related to Postman usage and not the API itself.

    - Respond with the following to be consistent with the attributes provided by other errors sent by the API:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Not Authorized",
      "detail": "Upgrade to Plus to use this feature",
      "status": "401"
    }
    ```
    - rather than:
    ```json
    {
      "errors": "Not Authorized",
      "body": "Upgrade to Plus to use this feature"
    }
    ```

        - "In other state Reports, if a return has already been filed, and a refund takes place after the return is filed, the state may require you to file an amended return [to claim a refund for sales tax remitted], rather than [deducting that amount] from the next filing period‚Äôs return."

- https://www.taxjar.com/states/california-sales-tax-online/#do-you-have-economic-nexus-in-california

  - [ ] Perhaps specify that this applies to sales into California, e.g.:

    - "Effective April 1, 2019, California considers retailers who make more than $100,000 in taxable annual sales [in the state] or conduct more than 200 transactions annually [in the state] to have economic nexus."
